# Machine Learning/Deep Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of the machine learning and deep learning projects I had completed during my studies for the Master of Data Science at the University of Sydney. The tools used to build the models includes Keras and PyTorch.

- **Fashion-MNIST Image Classification**
- **Time Series Forecasting for Customer Price Index (CPI)**
- **Image Reconstruction with Non-negative Matrix Factorization**
- **Label-noise Laerning with Transition Matrix for Image Classification**

## Fashion-MNIST Image Classification

*This is a collaboration with Yuxuan Mu for the final project of Machine Learning and Data Mining in S2 2022.*

## Time Series Forecasting for Customer Price Index (CPI)

*This is a collaboration with Yuxun Mu, Diogo Melo Paes, Rafiul Nakib, and William Miao for the final project of Predictive Analytics in S1 2023.*


## Image Reconstruction with Non-negative Matrix Factorization

*This is a collaboration with Ke Wang and Zijie Zhao for the mid-term project of Advanced Machine Learning in S2 2022.*

## Label-noise Laerning with Transition Matrix for Image Classification

*This is a collaboration with Ke Wang and Zijie Zhao for the final project of Advanced Machine Learning in S2 2022.*
