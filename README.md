# Machine Learning/Deep Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of the machine learning and deep learning projects I had completed during my studies for Master of Data Science at the University of Sydney. Data used in some of these projects are not provided due to non-disclosure agreement, but I provided my code with some explanations as a reference in case someone would like to solve similar tasks and could have a reference.

The domains that these projects involved include:

- **Fashion-MNIST Image Classification**
- **Time Series Forecasting for Customer Price Index (CPI)**
- **Image Reconstruction with Non-negative Matrix Factorization**
- **Label-noise Learning with Transition Matrix for Image Classification**

All of them were done by jupyter notebook, and the tools I used are mostly scikit-learn, Keras, and PyTorch.

## Fashion-MNIST Image Classification

*Collaborator: Yuxuan Mu*

In this project, three different models, including random forest, feed-forward neural network, and convolutional neural network, were constructed to classify the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The entire data preprocessing, training, and hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation process were presented. The runtime for training and evaluation was also recorded for comparison.



## Time Series Forecasting for Customer Price Index (CPI)

## Image Reconstruction with Non-negative Matrix Factorization

*Collaborator: Ke Wang, Zijie Zhao*

## Label-noise Learning with Transition Matrix for Image Classification
