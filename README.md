# Machine Learning/Deep Learning Projects

**NOTE: This repository is only for SHARING. Please DO NOT copy my code in case of PLARGARISM.**

This repository is a collection of the machine learning and deep learning projects I had completed during my studies for Master of Data Science at the University of Sydney. Data used in some of these projects are not provided due to non-disclosure agreement, but I provided my code with some explanations in case someone would like to have a reference to solve similar problems.

The domains that these projects involved include:

- **Fashion-MNIST Image Classification**
- **Time Series Forecasting for Customer Price Index (CPI)**
- **Image Reconstruction with Non-negative Matrix Factorization**
- **Label-noise Learning with Transition Matrix for Image Classification**

All of them were done by jupyter notebook, and the tools I used are mostly scikit-learn, Keras, and PyTorch.



## Fashion-MNIST Image Classification

This is a beginner-level project for image classification. In this project, three different models, including Random Forest, FFNN, and CNN, were constructed to classify the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The entire procedure including data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, training and evaluation were presented in details. The runtime for training and evaluation was also recorded for comparison.

## Time Series Forecasting for Customer Price Index (CPI)

*Collaborator: Yuxun Mu, Diogo Melo Paes, Rafiul Nakib, William Miao*

This project used various forecasting methods to forecast the Customer Price Index in the future. Methods used in this project includes time series decomposition, linear regression, exponential smoothing, ARIMA, and LSTM. aprameters were fine tuned based on the characteristics presented in the data, such as trend and seasonality.
